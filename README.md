## 🌟 About OpenJobHub

OpenJobHub is a **completely free and open-source** global job board platform, powered by GitHub Issues and GitHub Pages. We believe job discovery should be:

- ✅ **Open** - No hidden fees, no paywalls
- ✅ **Transparent** - All job postings are public GitHub Issues
- ✅ **Global** - Supporting 30+ countries and regions
- ✅ **Secure** - Manual review process to prevent spam and scams

## 📝 How to Post a Job

- **Location** - Specific city or location
- **Salary Range** - Provide a clear salary range (e.g., $100k-$150k USD/year, TWD 1.2M-1.8M/year). Transparency helps everyone!

### Step 3: Submit and Wait for Approval

3. **Wait for review** - A moderator will review your posting
4. Once approved, an `approved` label will be added
5. Your job will appear on the website within seconds! 🎉

## ⭐ Review Process

To ensure quality and prevent spam, **all job postings undergo manual review**:

- ✅ Moderators review each posting for legitimacy
- ✅ Approved postings receive the `approved` label
- ✅ Only approved jobs appear on the website
- ❌ Spam, scams, and inappropriate content will not be approved

This keeps our platform safe and trustworthy for job seekers!

## 🚨 How to Report Problematic Job Postings

If you encounter a job posting that seems suspicious or inappropriate:

### Step 1: Comment on the Issue

Go to the problematic job posting (GitHub Issue) and leave a comment tagging the moderator:

```
@junminhong This job posting appears to be [spam/scam/inappropriate] because...
```

### Step 2: Explain the Reason

Provide a brief explanation:
- **Spam** - Duplicate or irrelevant posting
- **Scam** - Requesting payment, suspicious requirements
- **Inappropriate** - Discriminatory, offensive content
- **Invalid** - Not a real job opportunity

### Step 3: Moderator Review

The moderator will:
1. Review your report and the job posting
2. Investigate the issue
3. Take action if necessary:
   - Remove the `approved` label (job disappears from website)
   - Close the issue (job permanently removed)
   - Request clarification from the poster
